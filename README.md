+ In project we have tried and implement file transfer among the client and server and
 some of its specifications like 'persistent connection', 'non-persistent connection'
 using socket programming and have applied a touch of HTTP protocol.

+ What is:
  1. Persistent Connection: The connection where the client asking
	                         for more than one file or data need not
	                         reconnect to the server each time after
	                         data sending.
  2. Non Persistent Connection: The connection where the client asking
	                         for more than one file or data need to
	                         reconnect to the server each time after
	                         data sending.
